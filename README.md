Introduction
------------

8th Wonderland is a community project aiming for the establishment of a cyber-democracy experiment.

This repository contains the main sources used to make the website working.

The website is currently located at http://8thw.la-citadelle.net.

It is an open project, anyone can contribute. Please see **Contribute** part for more informations.

Install
-------

Go in your project folder and execute the following command :

```shell
git clone git@github.com:Kern046/8thWonderlandV4.git 8thwonderland
```

Then, all the project files will be located in the ``8thwonderland`` folder.

In the folder ``8thwonderland/src/Application/config/``, you must copy the file ``config.json.dist`` and name it ``config.json``.

Then, replace the configuration values at the bottom of the file with the right values.

In the ``8thwonderland/dump/`` folder, you will find two dump files. These files will initialize the database structure and minimal data to make the application work.
